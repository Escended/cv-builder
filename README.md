# CV-Builder

A small web application built using React which allows you to get a quick idea of what your CV could look like.

The header is built using editable text components which I found here https://joelmturner.com/blog/inline-text-edit-react-hooks/

Rest of the sections are built out using react hooks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
